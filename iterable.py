#list, set, tuple,
# A list is more like an array in other PL  
f_lsit = ['Milkish', 'Milkish', 'Salty']

#SET doesn't allow duplicated data but mutated

#TUPLE:immutatble are for hard coded list with duplicated entries in a particular order
f_tuple = ( 'Malty', 'Salty', 'Milkish')

#DICTIONARY is mutatble, it just like Javascript objects
